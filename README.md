# No-Deception
### Abstract
Our primary source of knowledge is rife with misinformation, and it can be difficult to verify sources and avoid confirmation bias. No Deception provides live fact-checking and bias readings of any post or article. It will back up statistics, link the related studies, and provide external sources for further exploration.
### Goal
We want to provide an easy way to navigate the internet by removing the overhead of fact-checking. We seek to provide the ability to see at a glance whether a site or post is biased, contains inaccuracies, or is malicious.

The Respository will consist of a source code folder with directories for the front end and back end. The front end will have the UI and assets, and the back end will have databases and API configuration. There will be a testing folder within each of these.
