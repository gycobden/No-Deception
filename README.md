# No-Deception
### Abstract
Our primary source of knowledge is rife with misinformation, and it can be difficult to verify sources and avoid confirmation bias. No Deception provides live fact-checking and bias readings of any post or article. It will back up statistics, link the related studies, and provide external sources for further exploration.
### Goal
We want to provide an easy way to navigate the internet by removing the overhead of fact-checking. We seek to give the ability to see at a glance whether a site or post is biased, contains inaccuracies, or is possibly malicious.
### Current Practice
People increasingly get their information from social media. With algorithms that prioritize engagement and the loss of fact-checking in platforms like Meta and Twitter, the spread of misinformation has never been broader. 
Unassuming posts and articles are driven by bias and use methods to manipulate statistics and can even present true information disingeniously. It can be fatiguing to constantly verify sources, and it seems impossible to avoid some misinformation. Even for conscious individuals, it’s much too easy to overlook claims, especially if they align with your beliefs
### Novelty
Utilizing LLMs, No Deception will provide a live analysis of any text, whether that’s a social media post or a website. The UI will be especially functional, highlighting parts of the text that are subjective and providing links to other trusted sources to prompt further investigation. This approach solves the impossible overhead of individually fact-checking every post by making truth-seeking obvious and effortless.
### Effects
With the advances and acceleration of information sharing providing more avenues for misinformation to spread than ever, there needs to be widespread, effective measures to counteract it. We felt the effects of misinformation during the pandemic, and we are experiencing more now with the rhetoric of our politicians toward the economy and climate change. The more informed the population is, the more progress we will make towards a safer and better future for ourselves and the next generations. For that, we need to make finding credible information easy and attractive. We need to end deception online.
